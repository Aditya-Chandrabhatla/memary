Ah, the Deathly Hallows! In the Harry Potter series, the Deathly Hallows are three powerful objects that are believed to be the key to defeating Lord Voldemort. They are:

1. The Elder Wand, a powerful and dangerous wand made from the wood of an elder tree, said to be unbeatable in battle.
2. The Resurrection Stone, a stone that has the power to bring the dead back to life, but at a terrible cost.
3. The Cloak of Invisibility, a cloak that makes the wearer invisible, passed down through generations of the Peverell family.

Together, these three objects are believed to make the possessor the Master of Death, and are the ultimate goal of many characters in the series.
