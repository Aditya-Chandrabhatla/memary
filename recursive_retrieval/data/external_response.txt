assistant: The Deathly Hallows are a trio of magical objects in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series: a hollowed-out Elder Wand, a Resurrection Stone, and a Cloak of Invisibility. These artifacts are known as the "Hallows" because they bring the wielder closer to immortality. They are important plot elements in the seventh book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," as Harry, Ron, and Hermione seek to destroy Voldemort and end the war between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix.
