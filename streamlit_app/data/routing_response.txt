Observation: The logo you've provided is indeed the logo of the Dallas Mavericks, a professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas. The logo features a silver basketball with a blue outline, and inside the basketball is a white silhouette of a horse's head, which is a nod to the "Maverick" name. The horse's mane is stylized to look like it's in motion. Above the basketball is the word "DALLAS" in white capital letters, and below the basketball, the word "MAVERICKS" is written in bold white capital letters with a western-style font, all within a silver and blue shield-like design. There is also a lone white star just below the basketball, which is a common symbol in Texas, known as the "Lone Star State."
