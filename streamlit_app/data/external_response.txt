assistant: Zebras are equids, members of the horse family, known for their distinctive black-and-white striped coats. They are divided into three species: Gr√©vy's zebra (E. grevyi), quagga (E. quagga), and Burchell's zebra (E. burchellii). These species have different patterns of stripes, with Grevy's zebra having the narrowest and closest stripes, and plains zebras having wider and more spaced stripes.

Zebras are herbivores, primarily eating grasses and sedges, but will also consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and roots. Their diets vary depending on the species and habitat. Plains zebras are more water-dependent and live in moister environments, while mountain zebras can survive in drier conditions. They have a simple, less efficient digestive system compared to ruminants but can subsist on low-quality vegetation.

Zebras have excellent hearing and eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour). They have a complex social structure, with different species exhibiting various forms of organization. Plains and mountain zebras live in stable family groups, while Grevy's zebras have territorial males.

Zebras face threats from human activities, including habitat loss and poaching for their meat and skins. As a result, two of the three species, Grevy's zebra and quaggas, are now extinct, while the remaining populations of all three species are declining.
