        "content": "rag: The Dallas Mavericks are a professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas. They were founded in 1980 and are a member of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are also a member of the Western Conference Southwest Division. The Mavericks are known to be rivals with the San Antonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets, both of which are also NBA teams. The Mavericks' logo features a blue horse with a green basketball in the background. The logo features a silver basketball with a blue outline, and inside the basketball is a white silhouette of a horse's head, which is a nod to the \"Maverick\" name. The horse's mane is stylized to look like it's in motion. Above the basketball is the word \"DALLAS\" in white capital letters, and below the basketball, the word \"MAVERICKS\" is written in bold white capital letters with a western-style font, all within a silver and blue shield-like design. There is also a lone white star just below the basketball, which is a common symbol in Texas, known as the \"Lone Star State.\""
